PROPOSED TESTING ENVIRONMENTS:
	The best series of environments to run tests to make sure maximum interoperability is to verify the website works on multiple browsers, Mozilla Firefox
	Opera, Edge, Safari, Chrome, etc. It also would be lucrative to test on multiple operating systems Mac OSX, Windows, and Linux. Following that it would 
	be good to test with varying screen sizes (probably the most important). This would mean trying the website out on laptops, smartphones, Desktop 
	computers, etc. This would ensure that the website works in a plethora of environments since websites are probably one of the most in need of ensuring
	interoperability.
